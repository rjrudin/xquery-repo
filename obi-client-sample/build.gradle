/**
 * You can use this project as a starting point for a new OBI project. For details on how the Gradle file works, please
 * see the sample-project in the marklogic-java Github repository - https://github.com/rjrudin/marklogic-java/tree/master/sample-project.
 *
 * To install this sample app, just run "gradle mlDeploy" from this directory. This will install OBI along with the
 * modules found in the src/main/xqy directory in this project. You can then go to http://localhost:8025/v1/resources/api to see the 
 * documentation for the OBI services and the "my-service" service that is installed.
